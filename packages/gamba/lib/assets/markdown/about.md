### The Site

**Gamba** is a searchable directory of climbing videos organized by technique, type of hold, grade, and location. Anybody is welcome to submit videos no matter their level of climbing experience, as long as it showcases a cool move or problem!

On the technical front, Gamba is built using [VulcanJS](http://vulcanjs.org), an open-source React & GraphQL framework. Gamba itself is [open-source too](https://github.com/SachaG/Gamba)!

### Gamba?

“Gamba!” is the Japanese equivalent of “Come on!” or “Allez!”, and you can't spend any time inside a Japanese climbing gym without hearing it shouted out at least a good dozen time. 

Hearing “Gamba!” makes you want to push yourself to the limit, and encourages you to to climb harder and better. Just like this site!
