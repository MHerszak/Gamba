# Gamba!

### Your daily dose of climbing video inspiration

This is the codebase for [gambaclimbing.com](http://gambaclimbing.com), a directory of climbing videos. 

Gamba! is open-source and based on the [Vulcan](http://vulcanjs.org) framework, using the [Fuji](https://github.com/VulcanJS/Fuji-Theme) theme. 

To get started: clone this repo (instead of the main Vulcan repo), then refer to the [Vulcan documentation](http://docs.vulcanjs.org/#Install).

### Fuji Theme

It's recommended you clone the Fuji theme repo locally into another directory outside of the Gamba! repo. You can then use the [`METEOR_PACKAGE_DIRS`](https://docs.meteor.com/environment-variables.html#METEOR-PACKAGE-DIRS) environment variable to help Meteor locate the theme package.
